# Ruan-Linear-Regression
I used the Linear Regression Model in Spark using IntelliJ IDE to predict revenue for an online store based on page load time.   The dataset consist of two columns. This first colomn is normalized version of the Amount spend by customer and the second column consist of the page load speed for each customer.
